## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Conda**: This project uses Conda for environment management. Make sure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `env` directory.
2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   conda create --name svs_patch_env python=3.8
   conda activate svs_patch_env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## üìÅ Code Structure

The project is organized into two main modules:

1. **`patch_extractor`**: Contains scripts for extracting patches from SVS files.
2. **`analyze_patch`**: Contains notebooks and scripts for analyzing the extracted image patches.

## üíª Usage

### 1. `patch_extractor`

This module is used to extract image patches from `.svs` files.

* **`extract_patch.py`**:
* **Functionality**: Extracts image patches from an SVS file, distinguishing between tissue and background using eigenvalue analysis.
* **Libraries**: `openslide`, `numpy`, `PIL`, `os`
* **Usage**:
 ```
 # Set the target path to save patches
 target_path = r'/path/to/save/patches/'
 
 # Set the root directory of the SVS files
 svs_root = '/path/to/svs/files'
 ```

* **`region_extract.py`**:
* **Functionality**: Extracts a patch of a specific size from designated coordinates.
* **Libraries**: `openslide`, `PIL`
* **Usage**: Use the `extract_patch` function by setting `slide_path`, `x`, `y`, and `tile_size`.

* **`naming.py`**:
* **Functionality**: Renames the extracted patch image files sequentially.
* **Libraries**: `os`, `glob`
* **Usage**:
 ```
 rename_files_with_numbering(
     folder_path='/path/to/images',
     prefix='patch_',
     start_num=1,
     num_digits=3,
     extension_filter=['*.png', '*.jpg', '*.jpeg']
 )
 ```

### 2. `analyze_patch`

This module is used for analyzing and visualizing the extracted patches.

* **`plt.ipynb`**:
* **Functionality**: Performs image feature analysis and visualization. It calculates the RGB covariance matrix, analyzes eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and generates scatter plots.

* **`3d_scatter_plot.py`**:
* **Functionality**: Visualizes the RGB pixel values of an image in a 3D space using Plotly for an interactive experience.

* **`project.ipynb`**:
* **Functionality**: Projects RGB data points onto a plane defined by the top three eigenvectors for 2D visualization while retaining RGB color information.

## üî¨ Methodology

The core of this project lies in its ability to differentiate tissue from the background in whole slide images. This is achieved by:

1. Calculating the **RGB Covariance Matrix** for image patches.
2. Computing the **eigenvalues and eigenvectors** from this matrix.
3. Applying a set of **judgement conditions** based on the mean of RGB channels and the calculated eigenvalues to filter out background and markings, thereby isolating tissue-only patches.

This algorithm allows for the rapid and accurate extraction of relevant tissue regions from large datasets.
